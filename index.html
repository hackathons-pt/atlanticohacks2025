                <h1>but, what is a hackathon?</h1>
                <p><strong>in short: several people in teams, coding for a certain amount of time to win prizes.</strong></p>
                <p>they are special events where several people get together and code in teams (usually) to try to win prizes. depending on the type of hackathon you attend (from regular ones more aimed at adults, to codeday and hack club which are more aimed at teens/high schoolers), you'll have different experiences.</p>
                <p>the goal here is for you to have the best possible experience. you'll learn to code and have a lot of fun.</p>

                <h1>what is atlânticoHacks?</h1>
                <p>atlânticoHacks is a hackathon for students from colégio atlântico that are in the 8th grade or above. the goal: unleash your freedom, and discover what you can learn.</p>
                <p>there's no limit to your creativity basically, well, except the roof of the building of course. but whatever you are able to make that is usable in these 24h, counts.</p>
                <p>we've previously organized Scrapyard Lisbon, one of the hackathons that happened in over 100 cities by hack club, and we were the best hackathon out of the over 100, with the best score out of all events.</p>
