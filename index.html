                <p>they are special events where several people get together and code in teams (usually) to try to win prizes. depending on the type of hackathon you attend (from regular ones more aimed at adults, to codeday and hack club which are more aimed at teens/high schoolers), you'll have different experiences.</p>
                <p>the goal here is for you to have the best possible experience. you'll learn to code and have a lot of fun.</p>
