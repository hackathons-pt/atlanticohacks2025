            <h2>hi there!</h2>
            <p>hi there parents - my name is afonso and i'm a student at colégio atlântico and a part of club operations and engineering at hack club.</p>
            <p>hack club is a non-profit based in the US that has gave out over a million USD in prizes, and has helped over 50,000 students.</p>
            <p>i've also organized hackathons and events in the past, and this is the first hackathon we're doing at colégio atlântico!</p>
            <p>hackathons are truely magical experiences, which is why i'm writing this guide that will hopefully clear up any questions that you might have, to make sure your child goes.</p>
